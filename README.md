# Keyboard2Mouse
 Turns your Keyboard into a Mouse
Inspired from the youtube video of [this repository](https://github.com/HackerPoet/Trackpad), it required some modifications to work with [Mouse2Keyboard](https://github.com/M4rkFlor/Mouse2Keyboard)  
bassicly Trackpad_V2 but now you can use arrow keys and right ctrl and numpad-0 for left and right click.
