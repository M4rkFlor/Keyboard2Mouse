# Keyboard2Mouse
Turns your Keyboard into a Mouse/Trackpad  
Based off of [Trackpad](https://github.com/HackerPoet/Trackpad)  
I was inspired from the youtube video and need this to work with the both mouse and keyboard swapped.  
Modified to work with [Mouse2Keyboard](https://github.com/M4rkFlor/Mouse2Keyboard)
